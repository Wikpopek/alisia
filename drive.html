	<h1>Alisia drives a new car</h1>
<p>Alisia has never liked traveling by plane. She is an excellent driver and definitely prefers traveling by car. Using the suggestion that she had just bought a new car, she decided to use it for a new trip.Unfortunately the mountains in Italy are very dangerous to travel in and have a lot of cliffs. Unfortunately Alisia fell off one cliff during this trip.the car didn't survive but luckily nothing happened to Alisia, she only broke her leg.</p>
